I wanted to start tracking my progress on different algorithms as I practice for interviews.

Each problem is paired with a ReadMe and a code example of the challenge. 

Each problem documents the type of flow:

- Try solving the problem first
     - Even if not successful, document thinking process, like what methods were used. Type of problem, etc
     - If successful, write about the approach on how it was solved. 

- If unable to solve, ask GPT 4 to look at the code with the following prompt:
     > `There is this problem that I tried to solve on <wherever> <problem>
Here is what I wrote at first and I was getting <this result>
Can you tell me on how I can improve on this **without** solving the problem for me?`

- Try to solve with the hint from GPT 4. Document thought process.
- If unsuccessful again, have GPT-4 solve the problem. Verify it works by testing. 
     - If anything is unfamilar, or there is an approach that is new, document the process and anything new that this solution deals with.
